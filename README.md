# rna-seq-metadata-harmonizer
RNA-seq Metadata Harmonizer â€“ A reproducible pipeline for curating, harmonizing, and integrating RNA-seq study metadata. This project automates the extraction of sample information from multiple GEO datasets, assigns experimental conditions (e.g., control vs treated), and generates a unified metadata table for downstream analysis.
