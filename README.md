# rna-seq-metadata-harmonizer
RNA-seq Metadata Harmonizer â€“ A reproducible pipeline for curating, harmonizing, and integrating RNA-seq study metadata. This project automates the extraction of sample information from multiple GEO datasets, assigns experimental conditions (e.g., control vs treated), and generates a unified metadata table for downstream analysis.
# ðŸ§¬ RNA-seq Metadata Harmonization Tool

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Different RNA-seq studies often provide metadata in inconsistent formats, making it difficult to perform cross-study analysis.  
This project provides a **Python-based metadata harmonization tool** that standardizes sample annotations across multiple studies.  

It:
- âœ… Reads metadata from GEO series matrix files (`.txt.gz`)  
- âœ… Extracts sample IDs and treatment/control information  
- âœ… Handles inconsistent annotation formats (e.g., "control", "normal", "tumor")  
- âœ… Performs quality checks (missing values, sample counts)  
- âœ… Produces harmonized metadata in **CSV format**  
- âœ… Includes summary plots of sample distributions
